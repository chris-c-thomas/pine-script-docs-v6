# ta.valuewhen()

Returns the value of the `source` series on the bar where the `condition` was true on the nth most recent occurrence.

## Syntax & Overloads

```
ta.valuewhen(condition, source, occurrence) → series color
```

```
ta.valuewhen(condition, source, occurrence) → series int
```

```
ta.valuewhen(condition, source, occurrence) → series float
```

```
ta.valuewhen(condition, source, occurrence) → series bool
```

## Arguments

**condition (series bool)** The condition to search for.

**source (series color)** The value to be returned from the bar where the condition is met.

**occurrence (simple int)** The occurrence of the condition. The numbering starts from 0 and goes back in time, so '0' is the most recent occurrence of `condition`, '1' is the second most recent and so forth. Must be an integer >= 0.

## Example

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("ta.valuewhen")
slow = ta.sma(close, 7)
fast = ta.sma(close, 14)
// Get value of `close` on second most recent cross
plot(ta.valuewhen(ta.cross(slow, fast), close, 1))
```

## Remarks

This function requires execution on every bar. It is not recommended to use it inside a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) or [while](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_while) loop structure, where its behavior can be unexpected. Please note that using this function can cause [indicator repainting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/).
