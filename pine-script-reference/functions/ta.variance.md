# ta.variance()

Variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a series from its mean ([ta.sma()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.sma)), and it informally measures how far a set of numbers are spread out from their mean.

## Syntax

```
ta.variance(source, length, biased) → series float
```

## Arguments

**source (series int/float)** Series of values to process.

**length (series int)** Number of bars (length).

**biased (series bool)** Determines which estimate should be used. Optional. The default is true.

## Returns

Variance of `source` for `length` bars back.

## Remarks

If `biased` is true, function will calculate using a biased estimate of the entire population, if false - unbiased estimate of a sample.

`na` values in the `source` series are ignored; the function calculates on the `length` quantity of non-`na` values.
