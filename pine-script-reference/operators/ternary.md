# ?:

Ternary conditional operator.

## Syntax

```
expr1 ? expr2 : expr3
```

## Example

```pine
//@version=6
indicator("?:")
// Draw circles at the bars where open crosses close
s2 = ta.cross(open, close) ? math.avg(open,close) : na
plot(s2, style=plot.style_circles, linewidth=2, color=color.red)

// Combination of ?: operators for 'switch'-like logic
c = timeframe.isintraday ? color.red : timeframe.isdaily ? color.green : timeframe.isweekly ? color.blue : color.gray
plot(hl2, color=c)
```

## Returns

expr2 if expr1 is evaluated to true, expr3 otherwise. Zero value (0 and also NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) is considered to be false, any other value is true.

## Remarks

Use [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_na) for 'else' branch if you do not need it.

You can combine two or more [?:](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_?:) operators to achieve the equivalent of a 'switch'-like statement (see examples above).

You may use arithmetic operators with numbers as well as with series variables. In case of usage with series the operators are applied elementwise.
