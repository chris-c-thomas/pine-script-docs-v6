# syminfo.isin

Holds a string representing a symbol's associated International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), or an empty string if there is no ISIN information available for the symbol. An ISIN is a 12-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a security globally. Unlike ticker symbols, which can vary across exchanges, the ISIN for a security is consistent across exchanges. As such, programmers can use the ISIN to identify an underlying financial instrument, regardless of the exchange or the symbol name listed by an exchange.

For example, the ISIN associated with NASDAQ:AAPL and GETTEX:APC is US0378331005, because both symbols refer to the common stock from Apple Inc. In contrast, the ISIN for TSX:AAPL is CA03785Y1007, because the symbol refers to a different instrument: the Apple Inc. Canadian Depositary Receipt (CDR).
